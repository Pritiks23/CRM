## Overview

Fire CRM is a modern, single-page, front-end Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application inspired by Apple's design aesthetics. It allows users to manage contacts efficiently with a clean, professional interface that includes gradient backgrounds, interactive cards, and smooth hover effects. All data is stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`, ensuring fast access and no backend requirements.
